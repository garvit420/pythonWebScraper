# Price Comparison Tool

This Python project allows you to compare the prices and product names of items on both Amazon and Flipkart, providing you with a convenient table for quick insights.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   - `tabulate`
   - `requests`
   - `beautifulsoup4`
   - `random`

   You can install these libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install tabulate requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. Clone or download all the files in the 'scraperCode' folder to your local directory.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/garvit420/pythonWebScraper.git
   ```
   
3. Run the 'main.py' file to start the program.

## Future Expandability
This project can easily be expanded to include other websites by creating a new Python file for the new site, similar to the Amazon and Flipkart scrapers. Additionally, future updates may include a search by product name functionality to compare prices on multiple websites.
